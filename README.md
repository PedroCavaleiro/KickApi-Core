# KickApi Core
Basic API for Kick Streaming

This was a put together with just the functionality that I required

Also don't mind the messiness of the code as most of it is temporary while I wait for the public API to be released

The CycleTLS class was sourced from this repository [CycleTLS-dotnet](https://github.com/mnickw/CycleTLS-dotnet)

It requires [CycleTLS](https://github.com/Danny-Dasilva/CycleTLS) to be running for that in the terminal run one of the following files

* index.exe
* index-mac
* index

Depending on your platform (you must have NodeJS installed)

**NOTE**
This project will no longer be updated since Kick is taking too long to release it's API
